# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

it would be cool to have the circles in the header background "breathe" with an animation and also I would have liked to know that I didn't have to worry about the header image going outside the background circle ahead of time OR given the solution to make it look right as an option because that just frustrated me to no end and took up valuable time until Meaghan said not to worry about it because we will be learning how to do that in the next sprint and won't be penalized for it.
